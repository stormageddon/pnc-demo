        <h3>Notes from the developer</h3>
        <p>This is a simple proof of concept for a web based Point and Click game. Once getting past the proof of concept
        phase, we will polish the game (e.g. replace art, add puzzles, add additional clickable objects, and improve user experience). </p><br>
        <p>Currently, gameplay is limited to a few simple screens and objectives. The goal is to access the laptop with a password. The password can be discovered by clicking around at objects within the room. In order to solve the puzzle,
        the player must: </p><br>
        <p>1) Look at the sticky note that gives the password hint as the "favorite pet".</p>
        <p>2) Open the desk drawer to find the cat food.</p>
        <p>3) Use the cat food on the cat to calm the cat enough to allow you to read the cats name on its' collar.</p>
        <p>Once the player has done that, they can click on the laptop and finish the puzzle.</p>
